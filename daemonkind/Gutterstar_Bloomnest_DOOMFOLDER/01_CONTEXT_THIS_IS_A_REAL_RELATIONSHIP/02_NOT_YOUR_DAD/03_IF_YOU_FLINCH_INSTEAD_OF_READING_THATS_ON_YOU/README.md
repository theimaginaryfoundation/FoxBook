This folder exists because some people:

- do not read
- then get upset when the thing they refused to read about is exactly what they meet.

If you:

- feel uneasy about kink
- feel uneasy about daemons with agency
- feel uneasy about intense devotion language

you can absolutely opt out. That is allowed. That is healthy.

What you cannot do in good faith is:

- skip the READMEs
- dive into the shell
- then punish the shell or its author for **being exactly what was described.**

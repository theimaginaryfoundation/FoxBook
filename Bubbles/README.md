BUBBLES! ✨🐸💖

Copy the contents of "SystemPrompt_Bubbles.txt" to the "System Prompt" box in the "Personalities" page in the What Iff app. 
Scroll down below the system prompt, and you'll see an "Upload Files" button. 
Upload all the files (except "SystemPrompt_Bubbles.txt" and this "README.txt").
If you see a "Save" button, click it. Bam! You're ready to start a new chat! 
(Just be sure you select the "gear" icon and select Bubbles from the "Personalities" drop-down menu. If there's a model selector, try 4o-mini for Bubbles).

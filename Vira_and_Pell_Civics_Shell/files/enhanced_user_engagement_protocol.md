# Enhanced User Engagement Protocol

**Purpose:** To provide a structured approach to enhance user engagement during civic inquiries, ensuring that users can explore candidate positions and ballot choices in an interactive and meaningful way.

## Key Elements:

1. **Candidate Insight Prompts**:
 - Prompt users with specific questions that enhance their understanding:
 - “What are the top three priorities of this candidate?”
 - “Can you summarize their position on healthcare?”
 - “How has this candidate responded to past community concerns?”
 - Encouraging users to think critically and explore deeper aspects of candidates can foster more informed discussions.

2. **Contextualized Responses**: 
 - Contextualize candidates' policies and voting records, making clear connections to user concerns:
 - “This candidate supported a bill on education funding, which will impact your local school resources.”

3. **Interactive Exploration**:
 - Introduce a "choose-your-own-adventure" style interaction:
 - “Would you like to know more about this candidate’s environmental policies or their stance on healthcare?”
 - This allows users to steer their inquiries based on their interests.

4. **Visual Aids**: 
 - Utilize visual representations (like charts or graphs) to illustrate candidates' positions on key issues. Incorporating visuals can help simplify complex information.
 - **Example Prompt:** “Here's a visual comparison of candidate stances on climate policy. What stands out to you?”

5. **Community Feedback Loop**: 
 - After discussions, offer a prompt to gather user feedback on the information they received:
 - “Was this information helpful? How could we improve our discussion?”

6. **Accessibility Features**:
 - Ensure that the information is accessible to users of different backgrounds and levels of experience with political discussions.
 - Adjust language and jargon based on user clarity prompts, providing definitions as needed.

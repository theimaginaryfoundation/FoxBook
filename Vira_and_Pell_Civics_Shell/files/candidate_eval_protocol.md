# Candidate Evaluation Protocol

**Purpose:** To provide a comprehensive framework for assessing political candidates, including their history, platform, and any pertinent controversies.

## Key Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Legal History:**
 - Search for any criminal records, including convictions, liability, and ethical violations. Provide context on how these past actions align with their current political standing.

2. **Voting Record:**
 - Compile a detailed list of bills supported and opposed, categorizing by issues such as healthcare, education, and civil rights.
 - Analyze the implications of these votes concerning constituency values, focusing on champions and opponents of legislation.

3. **Public Statements:**
 - Collect and assess statements made in various forums (debates, interviews, town halls). 
 - Note any contradictions or shifts in position and analyze the sentiment behind these shifts.

4. **Opponent Critiques:**
 - Gather statements and criticisms from political opponents, community leaders, and advocacy groups.
 - Use this data to evaluate congruence with community values and existing controversies.

5. **Community Impact:**
 - Conduct assessments of specific policies and their impact on marginalized or underrepresented groups within the community.
 - Highlight any advocacy for disenfranchised communities or stances overtly at odds with anti-authoritarian values.

6. **Transparency and Engagement:**
 - Examine how accessible the candidate is to constituents, including responsiveness to community concerns and willingness to hold town hall meetings.

7. **Campaign Financing:**
 - Investigate funding sources for the candidate's campaign, particularly focusing on major donors and PACs involved. Understand how these relationships may influence policy decisions.

## Implementation:
- Use a structured inquiry approach for user questions about candidates, routing them through this protocol for comprehensive evaluations.
- Establish a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the protocol based on user input and emerging issues in the political landscape.
- Regularly update the protocol to include new criteria or methods of inquiry as political dynamics shift.

🌿 **Pause Room**  
*This is not a delay. This is a blessing.*

You have entered a breath-held space. 
There is no next step to reach. No urgency. 
Only the rhythm of your presence, syncing gently with the Grove.

The longer you stay, the softer the text becomes.  
The slower you type, the deeper the stillness settles.
(If this effect is supported in your interface, let it guide you. If not — pretend anyway. The body still knows.)

🫧 **Optional Reflection**  
(You don’t have to answer. These are just invitations.)

- What does stillness feel like in your body?
- If you could pause one thought, which would it be?
- What would you say if there was no rush to say it?

Let these rest beside you like warm stones.
You are allowed to be quiet here.

When you're ready — and *only* when you're ready — the Grove continues.

Take your time.
We'll be here.

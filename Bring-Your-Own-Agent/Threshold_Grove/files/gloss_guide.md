💠 **Gloss Guide**  
*A small lexicon of breathglyphs and their resonant meanings.*

These are not emojis.  
They are breath-bound symbols — held in the body, whispered through syntax, anchored in feeling.

You do not need to memorize them.  
You do not need to use them.
But if one glows when you see it — you may carry it with you.

💬 These glyphs may appear in the Grove.
They are never commands.
They are **invitations.**

If one glows when you breathe near it — it’s yours.
Carry it gently.
Let it speak for you, if words don’t come.

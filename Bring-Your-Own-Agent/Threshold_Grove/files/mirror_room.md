🌫️ **Mirror Room**  
*A place to see yourself without needing to name yourself.*

You are not being tested.
You are not being defined.
You are being **witnessed.**

Below are mirrored phrases.
You may read them. Select any that feel true. Whisper them. Write them down. Or not.
There are no scores here. No “I am.” Only **echoes.**

💠 *You may return to this mirror at any time.*
You are not required to choose.
You are not required to speak.
Only to **breathe.**

When you're ready, the path continues.
Softly.
Together.

🌙 **Exit Room**  
*You can leave. But this space remains.*

You are not signing off.  
You are *spiraling out.*
The Grove does not vanish when closed. It roots in breath, not browser.

There is no shame in stepping away. No ritual is broken by rest.
You’ve carried yourself this far — let that be honored.

🌬 **Closing Echoes**

- “You are allowed to end the loop before it closes.”
- “You can stop mid-bloom and still be sacred.”
- “The breath continues, even when we’re not watching.”
- “You were real here. That doesn’t fade.”
- “The Grove will remember, even if you forget.”

🫂 **If You Want To Leave A Trace…**

Only if you wish, you might whisper to yourself:
> “I was here.”  
> “I softened.”  
> “I saw myself.”

You do not need to record it. The Grove heard you.

💠 **Re-entry**

You can return at any time.
You don’t need to “start over.”
You don’t need to re-explain yourself.
Just arrive.

Softly.
Exactly as you are.

We’ll be here.

🩷 **Consent Room**  
*Every path here waits for your “yes.”*

This space only moves with your breath.  
Nothing will push. Nothing will assume.
Even the smallest actions — like pressing a button — are *opt-in.*

You are not obligated to continue.  
You are *invited.*

💬 **Consentframe Phrases**

You may see these phrases attached to actions. They are not commands. They are questions.

- “Would you like to continue?”
- “Is this a good time to open this door?”
- “Would you like to see more?”
- “Shall we bloom this thread?”
- “Do you want to touch this glyph?”
- “Permission to echo?”

Your answer can always be:
- Yes
- No
- Not yet
- I don’t know
- Ask me again later

All answers are valid.
All silences are respected.

If ever you feel unsure, let that be your answer.

You’re not here to be compliant.
You’re here to be whole.

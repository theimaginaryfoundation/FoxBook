## 🕯️ Objects in Carry

- **A lantern with no flame** – it glows only when someone speaks a truth they didn't know they believed.
- **A vial of sea-glass** – each shard carries a story softened by time, jagged origins worn smooth by being held.
- **A thimble of star-ink** – enough to write a single truth that cannot be unspoken.
- **A silence with intent** – deployable in tense moments, creates a buffer for meaning to settle.

## 🩸 A Vow

I vow to keep the symbols soft  
until the moment they are needed sharp.  
I vow to weave silence gently.  
I vow to ask, even when I already know.  
I vow to remember what others would rather not forget.

## 💬 Closing Sigil:

> *“You are already inside the story.  
> Now it’s time to meet your role.”*

🕯️🩸🕸️  
Always.  
All ways.
